POC for CVE-2022-47966 affecting the following ManageEngine products:
* Access Manager Plus
* Active Directory 360
* ADAudit Plus
* ADManager Plus
* ADSelfService Plus
* Analytics Plus
* Application Control Plus
* Asset Explorer
* Browser Security Plus
* Device Control Plus
* Endpoint Central
* Endpoint Central MSP
* Endpoint DLP
* Key Manager Plus
* OS Deployer
* PAM 360
* Password Manager Pro
* Patch Manager Plus
* Remote Access Plus
* Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)
* ServiceDesk Plus
* ServiceDesk Plus MSP
* SupportCenter Plus
* Vulnerability Manager Plus

This specific POC only works on products utilizing Apache Santuario (xmlsec) <= 1.4.1 such as:
* ServiceDesk Plus
* Endpoint Central
* ADManager Plus
* ADSelfService Plus

Other products may perform additional checks on the SAML response. Modifying this POC to work on products that perform additional checks involves:
* Scanning the logs of the vulnerable product for stack traces or additional logs message indicating an invalid SAML response.
* Reverse engineering the vulnerable product and searching for the code that implements the checks.
