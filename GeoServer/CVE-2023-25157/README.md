## 描述

This script is a proof of concept for OGC Filter SQL Injection vulnerabilities in GeoServer, a popular open-source software server for sharing geospatial data. It sends requests to the target URL and exploits potential vulnerabilities by injecting malicious payloads into the `CQL_FILTER` parameter. For experimental purposes, the script uses `SELECT version()` SQL statement as payload.

## 使用方式
To use this script, provide the target URL as a command-line parameter. For example:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 CVE-2023-25157.py <URL>
```
Replace `<URL>` with the actual URL of the target server.
