-    Questions for Confluence 2.7.x   2.7.34/2.7.35
-    Questions for Confluence 3.0.x   3.0.2

## Description

```
The Atlassian Questions For Confluence app for Confluence Server and Data Center 
creates a Confluence user account in the confluence-users group with 
the username disabledsystemuser and a hardcoded password. A remote, 
unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded password could
exploit this to log into Confluence and access all content accessible 
to users in the confluence-users group. 
This user account is created when installing versions 2.7.34, 2.7.35, and 3.0.2 of the app.
```

## POC
Hardcoded Credentials: 
 - User: `disabledsystemuser`
 - Password: `disabled1system1user6708`

## Were did you get the creds from?

The hardcoded credential were plainly laying inside the jar files of the affected plugin

`https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-atlassian-external/com/atlassian/confluence/plugins/confluence-questions/3.0.2/confluence-questions-3.0.2.jar`
