# CVE-2015-4852

## Description
During a recent engagement, I found that Nessus was now actively exploiting vulnerabilities for confirmation. When I checked the associated nasl script I found that the payload was generic enough to be used on a standalone script. Hence, I collected the payloads from all the nasl scripts that were part of the same RCE vulnerability (but for separate applications) and wrapped them with Python magic.
Next time you see a vulnreable application, use this script.

## Changelog:
* Update 29/02/2016
** Initial commit. Ready for testing.

## Author

## Target applications
* Websphere
* JBoss

## Code details

## What next
* Incorporate ysoserial.jar or its payload generation 
* Threaded exploiter - Weapon of mass exploitation :D
* Automated testing
